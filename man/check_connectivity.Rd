\title{Check Trial Network Connectivity}
\usage{
check_connectivity(data, genotype = "Genotype", trial = "Site", threshold = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe containing trial data.}

\item{genotype}{String. Column name for Genotype.}

\item{trial}{String. Column name for Site/Environment.}

\item{threshold}{Integer. Minimum number of shared lines required to be considered "connected".}
}
\value{
A list containing the connectivity matrix and a report of disconnected pairs.
}
\description{
A pre-analysis diagnostic tool. Calculates the number of common genotypes
between every pair of environments.
}
\details{
Factor Analytic models require genetic links between trials to estimate correlations.
If two sites share 0 varieties, their correlation is undefined. This function flags
those risks before you run ASReml.
