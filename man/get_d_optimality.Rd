\title{Calculate D-Optimality (Network Efficiency)}
\usage{
get_d_optimality(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{fa_asreml}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{total_d}{The determinant of the total information matrix ($D$).}
  \item{site_impact}{A dataframe ranking sites by their \% contribution to network information.}
}
}
\description{
Quantifies the information content of the trial network based on the Rotated
Factor Loadings ($\Lambda$). High D-Optimality implies the sites effectively span
the factor space (good coverage of GxE drivers).

It performs a "Leave-One-Out" analysis to calculate the "Impact" of each site.
Sites with low impact are redundant and candidates for removal to save costs.
}
\details{
The information matrix is defined as $M = \Lambda' \Lambda$. The D-criterion is $\det(M)$.
The impact of site $i$ is calculated as:
\deqn{Impact_i = \frac{D_{total} - D_{-i}}{D_{total}} \times 100}
}
