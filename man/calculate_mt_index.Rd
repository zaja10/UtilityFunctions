\usage{
calculate_mt_index(
  fa_objects_list,
  weights,
  penalties,
  thresholds = NULL,
  cull_strict = FALSE
)

calculate_mt_index(
  fa_objects_list,
  weights,
  penalties,
  thresholds = NULL,
  cull_strict = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fa_objects_list}{A named list of objects of class \code{fa_model} (output from fit_fa_model).}

\item{weights}{Named numeric vector of economic weights (w) for each trait.}

\item{penalties}{Named numeric vector of stability penalties (lambda) for each trait.}

\item{thresholds}{Named numeric vector. Minimum acceptable raw value for a trait.
E.g., c(Yield = 2.0, Protein = 10.5). Genotypes below this are culled.}

\item{cull_strict}{Logical. If TRUE, remove culled genotypes from the output.
If FALSE (default), keep them but set their Index to -Inf and Status to "Culled".}
}
\value{
A dataframe with standardized scores per trait and the final Index.

A dataframe with standardized scores per trait, raw values, and the final Index.

\description{
Computes a composite selection index across multiple traits, incorporating
both performance (OP) and stability (RMSD) for each trait.

Computes a composite selection index across multiple traits, incorporating
