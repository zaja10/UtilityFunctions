\title{Calculate Heritability from a List of ASReml Models}
\usage{
calc_h2_cullis(model_list, id = "Genotype")

compare_h2(
  model,
  fa_object = NULL,
  grm = NULL,
  classify = NULL,
  id_var = "Genotype",
  methods = c("Cullis", "Oakey", "Standard")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_list}{A named list containing fitted `asreml` objects.}

\item{id}{A character string specifying the name of the factor representing
the genetic random effect (e.g., "Genotype", "Variety"). Defaults to "Genotype".}

\item{model}{A fitted \code{asreml} object.}

\item{fa_object}{Optional. An object of class \code{fa_model} produced by \code{fit_fa_model()}.
If provided, Vg is extracted from the FA reconstruction. If NULL, Vg is extracted
directly from the model summary (supports US, Diag, and scalar components).}

\item{grm}{Optional. The genomic relationship matrix (inverse not required).
Required only for the "Oakey" method.}

\item{classify}{Character string. The prediction term (e.g. "Site:Genotype" or "Genotype").
If NULL, attempts to detect automatically from \code{fa_object}.}

\item{id_var}{Character string. The name of the genotype factor (trace term).
Defaults to "Genotype". Used when parsing variance components if fa_object is NULL.}

\item{methods}{Character vector. Metrics to calculate: c("Cullis", "Oakey", "Standard").}
}
\value{
A named list or vector containing the calculated heritability (H2)
  for each valid and converged model in the input list. Returns NA for
  models that are invalid, did not converge, or encountered errors during
  calculation.
Genetic Metrics

Functions to calculate heritability and reliability.

A data.frame summarizing H2, Genetic Variance (Vg), and Error Metrics per Site.
}
\description{
This function iterates through a list of fitted asreml model objects and
calculates broad-sense heritability (H2) based on the Cullis method
(1 - mean(PEV) / Vg), using the variance-covariance matrix of predictions.
Note: This function uses `predict(..., vcov = TRUE)` and may fail with a
"long vector not supported" error if the genetic factor has many levels,
leading to a very large prediction variance-covariance matrix. A safer
alternative uses standard errors from predict.

Calculates and compares three standard heritability metrics (Cullis, Oakey, Standard)
for each environment. Supports Factor Analytic (FA), Unstructured (US), Diagonal,
and Single-Site models.
}
\details{
\strong{Metrics:}
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Standard (Line Mean):} \eqn{1 - (PEV / V_g)}. Often referred to as Line Mean Reliability or Repeatability.
  \item \strong{Cullis (Generalized Repeatability):} \eqn{1 - (\bar{v}_{\Delta}^{BLUP} / 2V_g)}. Generalized Heritability/Repeatability for phenotypic trials.
  \item \strong{Oakey (Genomic Reliability):} \eqn{1 - tr(C^{22}G^{-1})/n}. Gold standard for genomic prediction accuracy.
}

\strong{Note on Terminology:}
While often loosely called "Heritability", these PEV-based metrics are technically forms of
\strong{Generalized Repeatability} or \strong{Reliability} (Squared Accuracy) of the
predictions. True heritability is defined as the slope of the regression of True Genetic Values
on Phenotypes (or BLUEs on BLUPs), which requires knowing the true effects or fitting dual models.

\strong{Optimizations:}
This function implements two key optimizations for large-scale genomic trials:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{Split Predictions:} Predictions are run per-site to avoid calculating massive
  PEV matrices (e.g., 20k x 20k) that would exhaust memory.
  \item \strong{Trace Trick (Oakey):} Uses \code{sum(A * B)} instead of \code{trace(A \%*\% B)}
  to calculate the trace of the product of two symmetric matrices, drastically reducing
  computation time.
