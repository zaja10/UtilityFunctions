\usage{
diagnose_design(data, genotype, trial, rep = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the trial data.}

\item{genotype}{Character. Column name for Genotype.}

\item{trial}{Character. Column name for Trial/Environment.}

\item{rep}{Character. Column name for Replicate/Block (Optional).}
}
\value{

\describe{
  \item{structure}{Counts of levels for key factors.}
  \item{connectivity}{Connectivity matrix (shared genotypes) between sites.}
  \item{aliasing}{Check if Reps are nested within Sites (Recycled vs Unique coding).}

}
\description{
Analyzes the experimental design of a dataset to check for connectivity, balance,
and aliasing between structural factors (e.g., Reps nested within Sites).
